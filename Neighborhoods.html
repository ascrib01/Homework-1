        <h2>West Village</h2>
        <img src="west-village.jpg" class="other">
        <p>West of Greenwich Village, south of Chelsea, and north of Canal. Home to the elegant and beautiful, the West Village is one of the most prestigious areas of the city. Charming, tree-lined narrow streets containing elegant townhouses and sophisticated restaurants. There is a perfect mix of cozy charm and alluring luxury. A great place to people watch while grabbing lunch al fresco.</p>

              <h2>Lower East Side</h2>
              <img src="les.jpg" class="other">
              <p>Bounded by west by Bowery, east by the East River, north by 14th Street, south by Canal. The Lower East Side is where I used to call home. It is the destination for old world meets new. An epicenter of history of the working class, the Lower East Side is now the destination for all things hip and experimental. Night clubs, trendy restaurants and cocktail bars, and art galleries are characteristic of this neighborhood. The grungy exterior adds to the feeling of excitement and discovery when exploring this area of the city.</p>

                    <h2>Soho</h2>
                    <img src="soho.jpg" class="other">
                    <p>Soho is the area south of Houston and north of canal, in central Manhattan. It is known for cobblestone streets, large lofted apartments, and to be an epicenter for shopping. While most tourists know Soho as the commercialized Broadway, the true charm is in the less traveled streets: Crosby, Sullivan, Thompson, and Lafayette. The quaint, lesser known area of Nolita sits just to the east of Soho, and is home to top tier restaurants and boutique shopping.</p>
